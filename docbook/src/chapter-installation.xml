        <para>
            If you want to install SHR on SD card you should read this section.
        </para>
        <section>
            <title>Prepare SD Card</title>
            <para>
                Before the SD card can be used, it must be partitioned and
                formatted.
            </para>
            <bridgehead>Find the device name of the SD card</bridgehead>
            <para>
                For the further installation process the device name of the SD
                card must be known. A simple test will provide the name.

                    <listitem>
                        <para>
                            Please open a terminal (also known as console) as
                            normal user. 
                        </para>
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>
                            Type in
                            <programlisting>cat /proc/partitions</programlisting>,
                            this will print the list of currently known devices and
                            partitions. An output may look like this:
                            <programlisting>
nschle85@dual-wohnzimmer:~$ cat /proc/partitions 
major minor  #blocks  name

   8       66  145998720 sde2
   8       67          1 sde3
   8       69    6040408 sde5
nschle85@dual-wohnzimmer:~$
                            </programlisting>
                        </para>
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>
                            Now plug the SD card into the SD card reader and
                            type again:
                            <programlisting>cat /proc/partitions</programlisting>
                        </para>
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>
                            Now compare the result of previous output with the
                            current output:
                            <programlisting>
nschle85@dual-wohnzimmer:~$ cat /proc/partitions 
major minor  #blocks  name

   8       64  244198584 sde
   8       65   92156841 sde1
   8       66  145998720 sde2
   8       67          1 sde3
   8       69    6040408 sde5
   8       80    7977472 sdf
   8       81    7976021 sdf1
nschle85@dual-wohnzimmer:~$
                            </programlisting>
                            In this case
                            <programlisting>
   8       80    7977472 sdf
   8       81    7976021 sdf1
                            </programlisting>
                            was the difference between both outputs. So the
                            device name of the SD card is
                            <quote>/dev/sdf</quote>.
                        </para>
                    </listitem>
                </itemizedlist>
            </para>
            
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Partition the SD Card</title>
            <para>
                In the previous example the SD card contained one partition.
                Please configure your SD card to have one partition using the
                whole space.
            </para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Create file system on the SD Card</title>
            <para>
                One choice is to use EXT3 file system. It''s a journaling file
                system, so a power loss of your phone should not destroy all
                your saved data.
                <warning>
                    Please use this file system only on your SD card because
                    it writes very often on SD card and that is not what
                    flash memory is made for. But SD cards are very cheap, and
                    destroying internal flash is very expensive.
                </warning>
                To format your SD card execute:
                <caution>
                    Please check, that you are using the right partition name !
                    If you use the wrong partition, you may loose important
                    data !
                </caution>
                <programlisting>
nschle85@dual-wohnzimmer:~$ sudo mkfs.ext3 /dev/sdf1

            <title>Copy SHR Image onto SD card</title>
            <para>
                Now you are ready to mount your SD card partition (please
                create the mount point before)and copy your SHR image to your
                SD card:
                <programlisting>
nschle85@dual-wohnzimmer:~$ sudo mount -t ext3 /dev/sdf1 /mnt/sdf1
nschle85@dual-wohnzimmer:~$ sudo tar -C /mnt/sdf1 -xzf /path/to/your/image/lite-om-gta02.tar.gz
